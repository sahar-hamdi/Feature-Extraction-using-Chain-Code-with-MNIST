### **Introduction**

  The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. In this project, we explore various machine learning classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, coupled with Chain Code feature extraction to classify digits.


### **Features**

  * Data Visualization: Original images from the MNIST dataset are visualized along with detected contours for better understanding.
  * Feature Extraction: Chain code feature extraction technique is used to extract features from images.
  * Classification: KNN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers are trained and evaluated on the extracted features.
  * Accuracy Visualization: Bar chart visualization of classifier accuracies for easy comparison.
 
### **Dependencies**

  * Python 3.x
  * scikit-learn
  * scikit-image
  * matplotlib
  * numpy


### **Results**
  * KNN Accuracy: 90%
  * SVM Accuracy: 93%
  * Random Forest Accuracy: 92%
